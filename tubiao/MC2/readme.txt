MOSAIC CREATOR

Mosaic Creator allows you to create a photo mosaics and thumbnails made of 
many  small  cells. Also  it   can  render good images using  least  image 
collections with  fine  color  enhance.  Specific for Mosaic  Creator  are   
optional   non-rectangular  pattern cell shapes  (puzzle, shape, triangle,  
hexagon, etc) and generating clickable thumbnails.

Mosaic  Creator  includes pattern shape editor  for user  defined patterns 
(only in professional version). You can start create mosaics only with one
image.

You  must  select  cell  images,  source  image, destination image size and
pattern type. You can enhance the rendering process by fine color modifying
the  cell images, and finish up the result mosaic image  by  adding  a cell
borders, alpha masks and color masks.  There is not limitation  for  number 
of cell images and output mosaic  file  size.  

The Mosaic Wizards simplifies the process of mosaic definition and preparing
thumbnails from your photos.
 

Mosaic Creator is shareware.
